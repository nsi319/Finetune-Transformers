She was in fact very secretive about who was family. The only one seen by her side everywhere was Sasikala Natarajan who as of today allegedly has all the power in her hands whether it is the party or the government.

""When she was not well she would speak about it on the phone. When she was feeling depressed she would tell me. She would cry on the phone,"" she said. ""But at that moment if anyone entered the room she would remain silent, she would not speak but would cut the call. I used to always think that it was Sasikala who had entered the room. Then she would not call immediately but would wait for 3 days or a week to call back."" Also Read: What exactly happened to Jayalalithaa? We got this from doctors who know MEMORIESAmrutha recollected the time she spent at Poes Garden with late chief minister in 1996-1998.

During a Congressional hearing this week, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher and Ted Poe, alleged that Pakistan is engaged in terrorism and asserted that the US needs to cut its military assistance to it. ""We need to go on the record here, on this part of our government, to say that were not going to be providing weapons to countries like Pakistan that were afraid will shoot down our own people and afraid we know theyre engaged in terrorism,"" Rohrabacher said during a House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Non-proliferation and Trade hearing on Foreign Military Sales. ""We know what theyve done now. They still hold Dr. Afridi (who helped locate Osama bin Laden)...in a dungeon,"" he said. ""We should be facilitating our support and our weapons systems to countries like Egypt that are fighting this threat to Western civilisation, to all of civilisation. And we should make it more difficult not less difficult for countries like Pakistan to get their hands on American weapons,"" Rohrabacher asserted. Congressman Ted Poe, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Non-proliferation and Trade, said that the US is having the issue with Pakistan whether ""theyre loyal or playing us for years on the issue of aid"" to Pakistan and sales to Pakistan. ""We were concerned about the Pakistanis scrambling F-16s that we made and sold to the Pakistanis so that they wouldnt shoot down Americans who were doing the job of taking out this terrorist.

8,"Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for 'centralising power' and taking away the independence of the states.

Thackeray questioned in an interview to the party's mouthpiece Saamana.","swapnil.rawal@hindustantimes.comThe Shiv Sena launched yet another scathing attack on its ally the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) through its mouthpiece Saamana on Sunday. In an interview to the newspaper, party chief Uddhav Thackeray attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused him of ?centralising? power.In a chat with Sena Member of Parliament and executive editor of Saamana Sanjay Raut, Thackeray attacked Modi over his style of functioning, demonetisation, Good and Services Tax (GST) and the PM?s poll pitch ?acche din?. ?The ?acche din? are only limited to government advertisement; the ground reality is completely different. Do we have true democracy in the country if all affairs are going to be run according to the wishes of the Prime Minister? He is centralising power, instead of decentralising it. He is taking away the independence of the states,? Thackeray said.Thackeray, who has been a staunch critic of demonetisation, said the move has not yielded anything positive, instead, it has affected the livelihood of people. ?Around 15 lakh people lost their jobs because of demonetisation. This means around 60 lakh people were directly affected. You should give them jobs now. How are you going to balance ?Start-up India?, ?Make in India? programmes with such colossal job losses? ? Thackeray asked.He also slammed the state government over the farm loan waiver. Thackeray said the government should table the list of 36 lakh farmers, who were going to get the benefit of the waiver in the upcoming Monsoon session. He said the party would continue its ?dhol bajao andolan? (protest by beating drums) to turn the heat on the government over implementing the loan waiver.Interestingly, the Sena chief said he shares a cordial relationship with Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. ?There was no personal animosity between me and the current chief minister. My relation with him is really good. Often, he has accepted the suggestions I have given. He is putting forward views of his party, I am representing the people of the state. The difference is only that,? he said.The two parties share an uncomfortable relationship ever since 2014 Assembly polls where they contested independently. Earlier in 2017, the BJP and the Sena parted ways for the Mumbai civic elections. Sena, which is the junior partner in the central and state governments, has never missed an opportunity to speak up against the BJP and the prime minister. Reiterating his stand, Thackeray said he and his party will continue to speak up whenever they disagree with the decision of the BJP in the state and at the Centre. ?I want to explain my stand here. Whenever I say something or Sena speaks, we are considered anti-government. I am not anti-government. I am merely on the side of the people,? he said."

Security services and counter-terrorism police are now investigating 27-year-old Butts motive in trying to get the job with the security company, the Telegraph reported today. Citing well-placed sources, the paper said that Butt had set up the job interview with the security firm that supplies safety stewards to Wimbledon and to Premier League football clubs. The interview was scheduled to take place at the end of this month. ""One possibility is Butt had considered targeting the tennis tournament but decided to speed up the plot, following the Manchester Arena bombing, and switched the attack to London Bridge,"" the paper said. Butt had previously worked for six months on the London Underground until quitting in October. Although he was under lowÃÂ­level investigation by MI5 and counterÃÂ­terrorism police, Butt was able to get a job working at Westminster station because employers are not made aware of security services concerns when performing criminal records checks, the paper said. ""The security firm would check his background but it does not have access to the police watch list or have knowledge of any MI5 investigation. There would have been no reason for him not to get the job.

""It would be wrong to say that this (US) administration has been ignoring India,"" officials added. Notably, this will be the first Trump-Modi meeting.","official (EDS: Incorporating Modi visit series) By Lalit K Jha Washington, Jun 24 (PTI) On the eve of Prime Minister Narendra Modis US visit, the Trump administration has dismissed reports that it has been ignoring India, saying President Trump realises that the country has been a ""force for good"" in the world and ties with it were important. ""I think that it would be wrong to say that this administration has been ignoring or not focused on India,"" a senior administration official told reporters ahead of the two-day Modi visit from June 25. The Prime Minister would meet President Donald Trump face-to-face for the first time at the White House on Monday. ""I think that the US really appreciates India, and I think that President Trump realises that India has been a force for good in the world and that its a relationship thats important. And I think that will come through in the visit on Monday,"" the official said. The senior administration official made the remarks while responding to questions on whether the US-India relationship has drifted under the new government, in part, because of President Trump and the administrations support to China. ""I think its a bit unfair. I mean, were only six months into the administration. But there have been two very good phone calls between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi that you can point to as showing both countries interest in the relationship,"" the White House official argued. ""Yes, this will be the first opportunity for them to sit down and have a conversation, but I think that this is still fairly early on in the administration,"" the official said. Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said President Trump and Prime Minister Modi would have a very robust discussion when they meet at the White House. ""During the meeting, the President and the Prime Minister will discuss ongoing cooperation, including counter-terrorism, defence partnership in the Indo-Pacific region, global cooperation, burden-sharing, trade, law enforcement, and energy,"" Spicer said in response to a question. Senator Mark Warner, Co-Chair of the Senate India Caucus hoped that Trump, in his meeting with Prime Minister Modi, shows enthusiastic support for deepening the US-India relationship, which enjoys strong bipartisan support. ""The relationship is ripe for additional cooperation in areas such as the development of aircraft carrier technology, space surveillance, unmanned aerial vehicles, cyber and increased defense manufacturing,"" Warner said. ""As we venture further into the Asian Century, there is little doubt of the increasing significance of India on the world stage. Our cooperation helps increase global security and advance economic opportunity in both countries,"" Warner said in response to a question. On whether the contentious H-1B visa issue would come up for discussion during the meeting, a senior administration official said it was unlikely to be raised from the US side but if raised by the Indian side, the Americans were ready for it. Ahead of the visit, Indian Ambassador to the US Navtej Sarna said the first face-to-face meeting between Prime Minister Modi and President Trump will give them an opportunity to look at the entire gamut of Indo-US engagement and to exchange views on issues of global interest. At the invitation of Trump, the Prime Minister would spend several hours with the US President at the White House on Monday afternoon, which would end with a dinner later that night. This would be the first working dinner being hosted by Trump for a foreign leader at the White House. ""I think that just shows the amount of care that has gone in on the part of the White House to welcome our Prime Minister and the kind of planning that has gone into make this a very special visit,"" Sarna said. ""This (dinner) is a special gesture and it is appreciated,"" he said. On the agenda of the meeting, a senior administration official told reporters that the civil nuclear deal would be part of the discussions between Prime Minister Modi and President Trump. The White House also emphasised that the US was looking forward to its nuclear reactors contributing to Indias energy security. It said the US is interested in providing India with the kind of defence technology it normally reserves for its closest allies, signalling the Trump administrations resolve to strengthen the bilateral defence relationship. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar here and told him that Prime Minister Modis Washington visit would strengthen the Indo-US relationship and help advance the common interest in fighting terrorism and promoting economic growth. The two agreed that the two countries have a deep and growing strategic partnership and hope to work more closely on regional and global issues. Jaishankar also met other senior officials at the State Department. Ahead of his visit, Modi yesterday said he looked forward to the opportunity of having an in-depth exchange of views. ""My USA visit is aimed at deepening ties between our nations. Strong India-USA ties benefit our nations & the world,"" he tweeted. "

Jelil Matniyaz, the party chief of a village in Hotan, Xinjiang was demoted from ""senior staff member"" to ""staff member"" on March 25 for his ""infirm political stands...and for being afraid to smoke in front of religious figures,"" a notice posted on the Hotan Dailys social media WeChat account said.

However, some religious people force ordinary citizens also to comply with the requirements, a senior official who had been working in Xinjiang for years, told the paper. The officials demotion is an isolated case, Tursun said, adding that the local government should balance de-extremist behaviour and local customs in the crackdown on extremism. The move to demote the official comes as authorities intensified their efforts to curb religious extremism. Early this month, the province where the Chinese security forces are battling recurring attacks by Uygur militants enacted a new law banning a wide range of acts, including wearing veils or growing ""abnormal""ÃÂ beards. In Xinjiang, the Turkic speaking Uygurs are restive for several years over increasing settlements of Han population from other provinces. China blames separatist East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), an Al-Qaeda affiliated group for the spate of violent attacks in the province. A number of its members reported to have joined the Islamic State militant group to fight in Syria. China believes that they would return to carry out attacks in the country. "

The court fixed the matter for further hearing on December 5. The lawyer appearing for the Centre submitted that more time was required for compliance as the record was voluminous. The court had on March 21 this year issued notice to the Centre on a contempt plea alleging the government took no action against political parties violating foreign funding norms despite the court order. It had sought response on whether action would be taken against them under the relevant law. The high court had on March 28, 2014 held that the BJP and the Congress had prima facie violated the foreign funding law by receiving donations from UK-based Vedanta Resources subsidiaries and directed the Centre and the Election Commission of India (ECI) to take appropriate action against them within six months.

44,"German water expert Martin Riese works as a water sommelier and is paid to taste water for Patina Restaurant Group in California. Riese, who has been drinking water professionally since 2005, is known to be the only certified 'Water Sommelier' in America. He also organises water tastings and classes to teach people how to identify different kinds of water.","You might think you have a high-paying and relaxing job, but what you do for a living is nothing compared to what Martin Riese does. He tastes different kinds of bottled water, and gets paid s**tloads of money for it!Yes, you read that right. Riese is a German water expert, and believes that water should be treated the same way as wine. What does that mean? Well, if we can go around tasting varieties of wine, measuring and comparing the depth of their flavour, then why can't we do the same thing with bottled water?So, instead of a wine sommelier (a steward or expert trained in wine services), Riese is actually a water sommelier. What makes his taste buds tingle is nothing less than H2O, which might come in differently-shaped bottles, and look clear and pure, but it's actually nothing of the kind.Not many people know that bottled water or mineral water is actually graded according to their TDS level. TDS stands for Total Dissolved Solids, or the mineral count in the water we drink. What this essentially means is that there is no bottled water that is pure (though it might look like it). In this day and age, water is treated, has differing mineral counts, and therefore different tastes. A water sommelier is just trained to identify these differences.Also read: Someone deep fried water successfully, just so you could have water pakorasAll you need to be good at this job is an unquenchable thirst for water. Riese is the only one who holds the title of water sommelier in the USA, where he moved from Germany in 2012. Apparently, water sommeliers are quite common in Europe, and all of them advocate water as the most precious drink in the world (now you just can't disagree with that!).Water has body, and depth--we all know this every time we drink some of it. But if the water sommeliers like Riese are to be believed, it has a lot to do with smell and sight as well as taste. Given the rising water crises we face globally, and our increasing dependence on packaged water, developing this sort of a flavour profile might just be the way to go for the future. And experts like Riese are actually doing their part in this venture."

","You may have to pay a parking penalty of Rs 100 an hour for leaving your car on the road in areas under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation. The charge could go up to Rs 1,000 for a full day?s illegal parking.The fines are part of a pilot project designed to prevent unauthorised roadside parking, a major cause of congestion on the city?s roads. If it succeeds, the east and south civic agencies could adopt the system too as previous drives to prevent people from parking illegally have flopped.The north municipality will enforce the penalty on roads 60 feet and wider, mostly near marketplaces.Delhi residents living along streets identified for the project will have to pay Rs 80 an hour for parking their cars by the roadside. Their vehicles will be towed away if they don?t. Even shopkeepers will be fined should they break the new law.The pilot project will be launched by this month-end in Model Town and Kamla Nagar.Read: Delhi?s new parking policy: Enforcement will be biggest task for civic agenciesThe penalty is applicable from 8am to 8pm on weekdays and Rs 50 will be added to the base fine of Rs 100 for each subsequent hour.Tailbacks, snarls and shrinking road space are growing problems for the city of 20 million, breathing the foulest air in the planet. The city has 10 million vehicles and toxic exhaust fumes contribute majorly to its air pollution.The courts, National Green Tribunal and government have put curbs and introduced initiatives to reduce the pollution, while the municipal corporations launched extensive drives to fine and tow away vehicles parked at unauthorised areas. But the deterrents haven?t worked much.?Issuing challans to every offender or towing away all vehicles from roadsides isn?t practically possible,? said Yoginder Singh Mann, the spokesperson for the north corporation.Besides, the fines are designed to be lower than what existing laws prescribe.Read: Parking on footpath in Delhi, may land you in jail, attract hefty fine under new policy?The Delhi municipal act says the penalty depends on the vehicle?s weight, rather than the size. That way the challan amount will be between Rs 10,000 and Rs 20,000 for each vehicle. Moreover, we don?t have space to keep towed-away cars,? Mann said.The north corporation doesn?t have tow trucks. It depends on private agencies and fellow corporations for such trucks during drives to prevent illegal parking.According to experts, the solution to traffic congestion is multilevel parking lots and discouraging people from using surface parking spaces by making them prohibitively expensive.The suggestion comes at a time the north corporation plans to double the rates for surface parking and by this month-end a pilot project will be conducted in Model Town.The success of this project may have city-wide implications. The three municipal corporations have 244 surface parking lots with a combined capacity to hold 50,000 vehicles. Of these, 99 are owned by the north corporation.The parking penalty project is initially restricted to Kamla Nagar and Model Town because these two areas have multilevel car parks. But people seldom use them because surface parking is ?cheaper and convenient?. Also, the unpoliced option of parking illegally on roads is always there.?We are expecting resistance from the people in the initial phase. That?s why only two areas have been selected for the time being. Based on the feedback, we might introduce changes,? said Renu Jagdev, the north corporation?s additional commissioner.Puneet Goel, the commissioner of South Delhi Municipal Corporation, called the north agency?s step a good move.?We will surely implement the scheme around multilevel car parking lots as their current use is extremely low. Also, it will reduce congestion on roads,? he said. The SDMC has six multilevel car parking lots.Mohanjeet Singh, the commissioner of East Delhi Municipal Corporation, has appreciated the move too.?We carried drives against vehicles parked illegally on Vikas Marg and challaned more than 1,100 vehicles. But this has not brought any drastic change to the situation. We will surely adopt the penalty parking scheme if it turns out to be successful in north Delhi.?Bhure Lal, chairman of the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority, said the initiative would help dissuade people from parking on the roadside, but most of them won?t want to pay the recurring Rs 50 an hour.?Unfortunately in areas such as Kamla Nagar, despite having a multilevel parking, people are congesting the roads. To ensure these facilities are utilised properly, the rates of surface parking lots should be increased manifold,? he said."

62,"Japanese company Konica Minolta has created a gadget called Kunkun Body that checks users' body odour for ?17,000. It can test for smells near the head, behind ears, under armpits, and around feet and rate them in three levels of severity. For example, on detecting high readings of smells, the gadget's connected smartphone app would display, ""Immediately care is needed.""","Worried your body odour is out of control but suspect your colleagues are too polite to say anything about it? Now there?s an app for that, too.A Japanese tech company has begun selling a device that allows people to self-test their sweaty exteriors for three categories of smell.The pocket-sized detector, which looks like a tape recorder, connects by Bluetooth to a smartphone app that divulges the potentially ominous results in a suitably discreet manner.Konica Minolta, the firm previously best known for producing cameras and printers, believes there is a market for the odour checker in Japan because people are ?particularly sensitive to smell?.There is even a word in Japanese for the behaviour of office workers who annoy others with their noxious aromas ? sumehara, or ?smell harassment?.At a launch event in Tokyo on Thursday, this reporter discovered the inevitable consequences of walking 30 minutes in the searing summer sun to get to the venue.A check behind the ear revealed fairly high readings of sweat smells and middle-fat odours. ?Immediately care is needed,? the app warned in a message on the results page.There was, however, nothing detected in the category kareish? ? which translates as old-age smell, commonly associated with the substance 2-nonenal.Daisuke Koda, who is the incubation lead at Konica Minolta Japan?s business innovation centre, said the idea arose after a discussion he had with several male colleagues, all aged about 40, two years ago.They were discussing the increasingly intense summer heat and confided in each other that they sometimes were afraid of how they smelled.?We looked for a device to measure body smell, only to find that there was no device at all to tell the different types of smells,? Koda told the Guardian.?That prompted us to think it might be an opportunity for a new business and we continued our research further deeper.?Studies showed that the number one etiquette concern in the workplace was body smell, Koda added. At the same time, people found it difficult to speak out about another colleague?s odours.?We see challenges that these people are aware of but nobody has a solution for,? he said.The resulting device is called Kunkun Body, which takes its name from the Japanese word for sniff. It can be used to test for smells in four locations: near the head, behind the ear, under the armpit and around the feet.The device is available to Japanese buyers as part of a set of care products in a crowdfunding drive launched on Thursday morning. Early adopters are offered discounts on the recommended retail price of 30,000 yen (US$265 or ÃÂ£206) with the devices set to be delivered later this year.The company said it had no current plans to sell the device outside Japan.It?s not the first device aimed at addressing smell-related worries in Japan. Last year, Sony released a portable aroma diffuser called Aromastic. Owners of the device, dubbed an ?aromatic Walkman?, can select which scent they want to be emitted in their vicinity.In a bid to beat the notoriously hot and humid summer conditions, people in Japan often carry around handkerchiefs to wipe away sweat and parasols to block the sun?s rays.In June last year, retailers and manufacturers reported an increase in sales of antiperspirants and wipe products compared to the previous year, according to a report by Jiji Press."

Besides, two of the four independents have backed the NDA, making a bloc of 131, which is nine more than the majority mark in the 243-member assembly.The RJD-led grouping has 107 members, including the Congress?s 27. Two independents and three CPI-ML members are unattached.Law experts believe a legal fight against Kumar may fall flat as the Goa and Manipur instances proved this year. The Congress won more seats in both states in the 2017 state elections, but the BJP tied together bigger combinations. The top court dismissed the Congress?s challenge.They said Bihar governor KN Tripathi?s action was not illegal.?After a crisis the concept of who has the larger and a stable combination comes. So the governor has the discretion to call a combination or party who will enjoy majority on the floor of the House,? senior advocate Rajeev Dhawan said.Governor Tripathi, who was admitted to hospital on Wednesday when the political drama played out in Patna, returned to Raj Bhavan and administered the oath to Kumar at 10am.The cabinet would be expanded after Friday?s vote, sources said.Sources said the JD(U) could get a ministerial position in the Narendra Modi government during a reshuffle planned after Parliament?s monsoon session. The move would make the ?alliance? complete at the Centre and the state, and check rumblings within the party. JD(U) leaders, including Rajya Sabha members Ali Anwar and Veerendra Kumar, attempted to persuade Sharad Yadav on Thursday to take the lead to oppose Kumar for allegedly not taking the party into confidence.Veerendra Kumar said: ?He (Sharad Yadav) told me there is no question of accepting the current stand of Nitish Kumar.?Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi also criticised Kumar for dumping the grand alliance and joining the BJP.?The mandate was against the communal stand of the BJP but Nitish has chosen to embrace them. We were aware of what was going on for three-four months. This is the problem with Indian politics. For the sake of power and personal gains, they compromise with anything.?BSP chief Mayawati accused Kumar of betraying the people of Bihar. ?Democracy will be weakened. This is another example of hunger for power.?For his part, Kumar thanked Prime Minister Modi for his congratulatory message after being sworn-in. He said his administration would not compromise on corruption and was hopeful that Bihar?s development agenda would gather momentum with the Centre?s support.Kumar?s decision to quit came hours after the RJD chief ruled out the resignation of his son and deputy chief minister Tejashwi, who is facing an investigation over an alleged land-for-hotels scandal.Speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary told reporters that in view of the trust vote, a day-long special sitting of the assembly has been convened on Friday.The BJP sent party secretary Anil Jain and health minister JP Nadda to the swearing-in.Nadda said: ?Kumar?s step is courageous and will send a positive message against corruption ... We will contribute to the state?s development with him.?The Kumar-Modi reunion makes the BJP-led NDA?s bid to retain power in the 2019 general election stronger. The BJP and its allies rule 12 states that send 20 or more MPs to the Lok Sabha.The opposition?s attempts at forging a united front against the NDA took a hard hit after the exit of Kumar, identified with good governance and probity.?Who will be key faces in any such opposition front in 2019? Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati, Mamata Banerjee, Lalu Prasad? None of them can corner us on the issue of corruption or good governance. Nitish was a different matter,? a BJP leader said.(with agency inputs)"

Officials said that water stock from the dam will ensure that only nominal water cuts happen next year. Notably, the height of the dam was increased in 2016 to accommodate more water stock. ","With the suburbs receiving sufficient rainfall over the past few days, the residents? water worries are likely to be taken care of.Thane residents will be saved from intense water cuts next summer, as ÃÂ BarviÃÂ dam that provides water to most cities in the district has now filled up to 99% of its total capacity ? 230.32ÃÂ million cubic meters .

72,"Actor Prabhas, known for his role in 'Baahubali' film franchise, has said that he's open to doing a Bollywood film. He added, ""I am open to Bollywood if I am offered a project that I can resonate with."" Speaking about his character in 'Baahubali', Prabhas said that he doesn't relate to it as the character kills a lot of people.","With the release of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion a week away, Prabhas, 37, talks about the making of the Baahubali phenomenon, what his superhero status means to him and life after Baahubali exclusively to India Today.What was it like to play two different characters - Mahendra Baahubali and Amarendra Baahubali - both iconic and superheroes but with distinctly different personalities?When you look at the characters of Amarendra Baahubali and his son Mahendra Baahubali or Shiva, the biggest differentiator was their backgrounds. Amarendra grew up as a prince and Mahendra Baahubali grew up amidst a tribe as Shiva.He is destined for greatness, he's as strong as his father and as able a fighter too but doesn't know where he needs to go or what he needs to do. He doesn't know that his mother and his kingdom are waiting for him. He is actually pursuing a girl who he is mesmerised with but stumbles upon a greater purpose in the process. He is a passionate and rugged sort of a guy who can be rather blunt sometimes but that's just how he is designed. He's not rude or crude, just a bit different.Amarendra, on the other hand, was meant to be the king of the biggest kingdom ever - Mahishmati. He is more self-aware and has also grown up knowing his life purpose all along. Ultimately, they are both for the people. Keeping these distinctions clear and imbibing their individuality helped me understand these characters better.Was it a risk to dedicate four and a half years to this project?It is an extraordinary script and as a principal actor I had to do justice to it. I knew that an epic film of this proportion would take this much time to be made. More than physical strength or action-training, a certain mental strength was needed to give unfocused time to a great director (S S Rajamouli). Luckily, I know him for 12 years and know his passion for his work. It wasn't easy, but it had to be done. Every three or four months, Rajamouli used to show us the completed visuals or share an improvisation in the script. It was intriguing and insightful and kept us enthused all through.Would you say that your performance is better in part two?Yes. Part one focused more on introducing the characters, while part two is the resolution and offered greater scope for performance as well.Do you relate to the characters you played in Baahubali?I don't personally relate to any character. It is a film after all. My character kills a lot of people in the film, that doesn't mean that I will get inspired by him and start killing people. It's all about how hard I can work to step into the character. From my point of view, it's only about how best I can play that character.What would you do to get into the Baahubali mindset before getting on to the sets?Once I'm told about the character, I can't stop thinking about it. Baahubali has strong arms and unbending courage; he is detached from luxury and is beyond political power. A balanced compassionate person, he doesn't react much or show too much emotion. All the intensity in him reflects in his eyes. That is what I would try to bring into my own eyes before getting on to the set. What was your biggest challenge with Baahubali?More than a challenge, it was an endeavour to make Rajamouli happy. He is the most mad and passionate man I know. I just went into this project with the attitude that I would do my best; even if part one didn't work, I would still do part two with the same dedication. What we believe in, we must do 100 per cent. It can't be a case of 50, 40, 30 or even 99 per cent. Any special moments you often recall from the shooting days?There are so many, I can't pick one. I was awestruck when I saw the waterfall for the first time. I feel quite nostalgic about that.You continued with your archery training even after the shoot was over?Yes, I enjoyed learning archery and whenever I can, I still practice. I'm fascinated by it.On the intriguing question of why did Katappa kill Baahubali?We never imagined that it would turn into a legendary question. Even Rajamouli didn't think that it would. People across the nation speculating on theories and the jokes doing the rounds on social media were most amusing. It was the love of the audience in their own way, I would say.Back in real life, do you sometimes approach a problem or situation asking yourself how Baahubali would have approached the same situation?I never thought of it, but if Baahubali were to approach a situation or problem, he would just smile it off. (Smiles)Who were your childhood superheroes?Superman, Spider-Man, Batman, the usual. I never thought that one day I will be a superhero, be part of a franchise and appear in comics. Not even in my wildest dreams I thought I would be part of a cult film and be remembered. I always dreamed big as an actor but the way things turned out, I never imagined it would be this big.There are perhaps children who look up to you today as a superhero just as you did while you were young.Well, I feel lucky for that. It wasn't just Baahubali, but Bhallaladeva, Sivagami, Kattappa, all have become iconic characters and will be remembered.What are your aspirations for the future?I don't know. I will try to do something better with my performance. It can't get better than Baahubali as a film; that was something magical and once in a lifetime. I'm open to Bollywood if I'm offered a project that I can resonate with.Most often you keep a low profile, and are seen as shy and reclusive. What do you have to say?I come from a large family of several cousins on both sides. When all of us get together, the noise and drama are nothing short of a marriage function. Perhaps I was always so content and comfortable with my extended family that I didn't quite go out and make too many friends. I didn't grow up into too much of an outgoing person. Some people from big families turn out like that, I guess."

Something as harmless as an ""Eid Mubarak"" can trigger unwarranted negative reactions directed towards you on social media platforms.ÃÂ This stems from the fact that there is a rising tendency, at least on social media, to filter people based on their religion and caste. For instance,ÃÂ  The fellow, who goes by the name ""Jai Shri Ram"" on Twitter, cannot fathom how a Hindu can wish people on Eid. This may make you question your belief in the secular fabric of India, but responses to such narrow mindedness will reinstate your faith in it. India is a secular democratic. A photo taken at Delhi's Nazrat Nizamuddin Auliya Dargah, dargah of world famous Sufi saint Hazrat Khwaja Syed Nizamuddin Aulia, is another example that will prove that no amount of hatred peddled through social media platforms and instant messaging applications like WhatsApp can destroy the secularism in India, within Indians.ÃÂ The photo tweeted by Mayank Austen Soofi, a Delhi-based writer and photojournalist, captured a scene inside the Nizamuddin Dargah -- a Muslim and Hindu praying at the shrine in their respective postures of praying.
