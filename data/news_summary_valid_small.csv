80,"Doctors at various hospitals have claimed that a large number of parents are demanding disability certificates for their children to get admission in schools. They added that in several cases, there is no disability. According to one doctor, parents even say that their child doesn't want to study Science, and request for an appropriate certificate. ","With school and college admissions being the flavour of season, doctors of city's top government hospitals are battling a rush of people with requests for issuance of disability certificates.Demands for disability certificates by parents and students come shortly after the Union government revised the disability act and made it mandatory for government hospitals to issue a differently -abled certificate. Previous disability certificates issued by private doctors are invalid now.A large number of parents are approaching RML doctors. The psychiatry department at the central government hospital is flooded with demands for disability certificates for students.MISUSEIn several case, experts diagnosed students with disability certificates with no disability. ""It is strange to find that even though the child is ineligible to get a disability certificate, top private practitioners' at leading hospitals have issued the same to him. It is a complete misuse,"" said a senior psychiatrist at RML requesting anonymity.Dr Smita Desphande, who heads the department of Psychiatry at RML Hospital told Mail Today, ""Our department has been getting at least 10 cases each day, wherein parents ask for disability certificate for their child to get admission done under the disability quota. Parents thus want their children to be categorised under any sort of disability- be it autism, intellectual disability or speech disorder.""Parents mostly come with their kids complaining Specific Learning Disability (SLD). If doctors approve, the child gets an extra hour for writing and preparing for CBSE, entrance and university exams. Mostly, requests come for students of private schools and colleges.ANYTHING FOR MARKS""Parents know disability certificates would fetch their kids marks, even if the spelling is wrong, and would allot them extra time during exams. Often they come to us saying, 'My child does not want to take up Science, so make the certificate according to requirements,"" said a doctor.""We have a specific tool to calculate the percentage of disability in a child. And when the assessment tool fails to identify any disability, parents force us to still issue a certificate. We were surprised to see that two leading private hospitals in Delhi have made forged disability certificates - which is unethical,"" said a senior psychiatrist at RML. Teachers, according to experts and doctors, are unaware of disability norms.RML doctors said parents are misguided by school teachers often.""There is very poor awareness in teachers. We get the reference from school teachers who ask us to get the certificate done for so and so and our department has been receiving an increasing number of referral case. There is a need for special educators in schools.""If a child is found to be not falling under the disabled category completely and is rather differently abled, with 5-10 per cent of disabilty, we provide that particular certificate and also often try to help them improve by intervention or speech therapy. We try to provide them whatever, treatment is required,"" said Dr Desphande.Last month, Mail Today had reported that that the Centre is bringing in 14 new categories of physical and mental conditions, under the ambit of the Disability Act, 2006. At present, the act provides the disability rights and benefits to seven special categories of people comprising blindness, low-vision, locomotive disability, hearing impairment, mental retardation, mental illness and leprosy.The new conditions will apply to people with cerebral palsy, dwarfism, muscular dystrophy, specific learning disabilities, deafness, autism, spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, haemophilia, thalassemia, sickle cell disease, multiple disabilities (condition of any two disabilities or more) and acidattack survivors.Ministry officials said the previous Right of Persons with Disabilities Act 1995, mentions only seven categories including people having 40 per cent and above disability, providing them all benefits.In 2001, disability assessment guidelines were prepared for these categories, but there was no measure to calculate the percentage of disability in a person. ""The ministry therefore formed a committee to review how to assess and measure the exiting as well as the proposed disability percentage in a person and accordingly entitlements would be given to the person,"" an official said.

82,"China on Saturday said there is ""no room"" for negotiations to resolve the military face-off and the only solution is the withdrawal of Indian troops from the Doka La region. Adding that the situation could get ""worse"", China's state-run Xinhua News Agency said that India will face ""embarrassment"" if it does not withdraw its border troops to its own side.","With no end in sight to the standoff in the Sikkim sector, China on Saturday said there is ?no room? for negotiations to resolve the military face-off and the only solution is the withdrawal of Indian troops from the Donglang or Doklam region.India will face ?embarrassment? if it does not withdraw its border troops to its own side and the situation could get ?worse?,ÃÂ  the official Xinhua news agency said in a commentary on Saturday night.?China has made it clear that there is no room for negotiations on this incident, and India must withdraw its border-crossing troops from Doklam. For China, border line is the bottom line,? the commentary said.The commentary sought to add yet another dimension to the face-off by bringing in the Ladakh region and linking it to Pakistan, China?s ?iron brother? ally. ?India should not regard the existing situation as the same as or even similar to the previous two standoffs in 2013 and 2014 near Ladakh, a disputed area between China, Pakistan and India in southeastern Kashmir. Diplomatic efforts led the troop?s frictions there to a well-arranged end. But this time it is a totally different case,? it added.It is rare for China to call Ladakh a ?disputed? region and make a reference to Kashmir.This is the first time that China has clearly articulated ? through one of its primary official channels - that there is no room for parleys to resolve the weeks-long impasse in Donglang, which is under China?s control but claimed by Bhutan.Until now, the foreign ministry had listed the withdrawal of Indian troops hinted as a precondition for resolving the face-off but had hinted there is an ongoing effort to end it through diplomatic negotiations.Xinhua is an organ of the Chinese government and is affiliated to the State Council, the Communist country?s cabinet.Commentaries published by Xinhua and the People?s Daily, the Communist Party of China (CPC) mouthpiece, are taken to be a reflection of the thoughts of the government and the all-powerful CPC.?India has repeatedly ignored China's call for pulling its border-crossing troops from Doklam area back to its own territory. However, turning a deaf ear to China will but worsen the month-long standoff and put itself further into embarrassment,? the commentary said.It added that India had ?lied? to the world by saying it dispatched troops to Donglang to help its ally Bhutan, whereas ?apparently? Thimphu had extended no invitation to New Delhi to intervene.?New Delhi claimed encroachment of its own territory by China before saying it sent troops to ?protect? its ?ally? Bhutan, a sovereign state which has apparently so far made no such an invitation for the sake of that boundary area,? it said.Bhutan and China don?t have diplomatic ties but have held 24 rounds of talks to resolve a boundary dispute.The commentary, however, described foreign secretary S Jaishankar?s remarks during a recent speech in Singapore as a ?positive? sign.?As an old Chinese saying goes, peace is most precious. It has been noticed that Indian Foreign Secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar recently has made positive remarks in Singapore, saying that ?India and China should not let differences become disputes?,? it said.?What China would like to see more are corresponding actions taken by India.?China has a will to solve the problem peacefully by diplomatic means, and China also cherishes the peace and serenity in the border areas, but the precondition is that the trespassers of India must withdraw unconditionally.?ÃÂ "

Reportedly, only 28% teachers are evaluating the answer scripts and only 6.5 lakh out of 18 lakh answer sheets have been assessed so far.

Farmers in Madhya Pradesh had dumped tomatoes on the roads earlier this year after a bumper production brought its price down, which then led to the shortage. Marketplace officials reportedly appointed six armed guards for protecting tomatoes after receiving requests from businessmen.","With half-a-dozen armed security guards around a truck, you would think it is carrying some precious cargo like jewellery or electronic goods.

Many a times, a passenger is turned away from the boarding gate if the tag gets misplaced,? said Singh. ?We are confident that no passenger can escape security check and thus there is no need of stamping. The trial run is for domestic travellers but it will be extended to international travellers also,? he said.Often if a traveller is asked to open a bag after it goes through a scan, others in the queue have to wait till their tags can be stamped. ?Now, if one passenger is stopped, others in the queue can move on to the boarding gate after security check. This will benefit the passenger and at no point, security will be compromised,? said Singh.Also read | Not fog, but pilots, airlines to blame for delays, Delhi airport tells DGCA"

96,"A signed and dated copy of theoretical physicist Albert Einstein's famous photograph in which he is seen sticking his tongue out is set to be auctioned off. Photographer Arthur Sasse captured the photograph as Einstein departed in the back of car following his 72nd birthday celebrations in 1951. Notably, Einstein had requested for copies of the photograph.","Wild haired with a bushy moustache and his tongue sticking out, the photograph revealing Albert Einstein as something of a prankster is one of the most recognisable images of the physicist. Now a signed and dated copy is about to be auctioned.Snapped by United Press International photographer Arthur Sasse as Einstein departed in the back of car following his 72nd birthday celebrations in 1951, the image shot into the public consciousness after publishers overcame their initial qualms and printed the jovial image.Even the Nobel laureate himself was amused at the photo, requesting cropped copies which he then signed and gave to friends. But the current auctioneers note that the image that is set to go under the hammer on 27 July is unusual in also showing the companions who left the Princeton club with Einstein that night: Frank Aydelotte, director of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton, where Einstein worked, and Aydelotte?s wife, Marie Jeanette.If previous sales are a guide, the latest lot could scoop a sizeable sum: copies signed by the physicist have recently sold for almost $44,000, with a signed, cropped version of the photo bearing a handwritten German rhyme selling for $125,000.Einstein?s leather jacket sold for ÃÂ£110,000 last year, but a photograph may be a safer bet for Einstein aficionados: the jacket was dubbed ?rather pungent? by the auctioneers."

99,"Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday announced a loan waiver for an additional 10 lakh farmers who had been left out of last month's waiver, which amounted to over ?34,000 crore. This will reportedly add a ?8,000-crore burden on the state. Fadnavis further criticised the Opposition for alleged anomalies in the 2008-2009 loan waiver package. ","Widening the scope of the farm loan waiver, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday said that the package would benefit about 10 lakh more farmers whose loans banks had restructured. Now, the loans of up to 46 lakh farmers will be waived. This will also put an additional burden of up to Rs8,000 crore on the exchequer.After days of protests last month, the government announced a loan waiver of Rs34,022 crore. A major chunk of the farmers whose outstanding loans were restructured in 2014-15 and 2015-16 owing to drought were left out. However, they were eligible for Rs15,000 and Rs25,000 in incentives because they paid their loans regularly. ?The outstanding amount of the farmers who got their loans restructured in 2014-15 and 2015-16 is Rs3,500 crore and Rs5,200 crore,? said an official from the cooperation department.In a reply to both the houses of the state legislature, Fadnavis said that the government would ensure that the package was not misused by ineligible people. He also refused to concede to the opposition?s demand to extend the cut off date to June 30, 2017 from June 30, 2016. He argued that this would set a bad precedent and was against the norms of the Reserve Bank of India. Fadnavis also attacked the opposition for alleged anomalies in the 2008-09 loan waiver package. He said at the time farmers in five-suicide prone districts in Vidarbha were given Rs286 crore, while farmers in Mumbai got Rs208 crore. ?There were beneficiaries from Mumbai who were not even farmers. They used this amount for commercial and construction works. A major chunk of waiver went to ghost accounts. Some of the banks even had revived their dormant accounts to reap the benefits. To avoid a repeat, we have asked farmers to fill up forms,? he said.The chief minister said that the government would scrutinise the list of more than 600 people from Mumbai, who had applied for the loan waiver. He also ridiculed the Congress and the NCP for their claim that the loan waiver was the result of their Sangharsh Yatra in April and May. He said that the protest march was a dud. In the legislative council too, Fadnavis said the erstwhile Congress-NCP government took?12 months and 15 months to disburse loan packages in 2008 and 2009 . ?The forms will be collected in a month. In August, we will scrutinise them and in September we will complete the first lot of the loan waiver,? he said. "
