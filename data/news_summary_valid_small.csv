40,"Republican Senator Lindsey Graham has said that US President Donald Trump has told him they would rather go to war to destroy North Korea than allow it to develop nuclear-armed missiles. Adding that he prefers a diplomatic approach to solve the North Korean threat, Graham claimed, ""There is a military option. To destroy North Korea's programme and North Korea itself.""","A Republican senator said Tuesday that US President Donald Trump has told him he would go to war to destroy North Korea rather than allow it to develop a long-range nuclear-armed missile.Influential lawmaker Lindsey Graham, a foreign policy hawk, told NBC?s Today Show: ?There is a military option: To destroy North Korea?s programme and North Korea itself.?Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un boasted that his country could now strike any target in the United States after carrying out its latest intercontinental ballistic missile test.World powers have been trying to stifle Pyongyang?s weapons programme through United Nations-backed sanctions, but have failed to daunt the regime and Washington is growing frustrated.Graham said if diplomacy, and in particular pressure from the North?s neighbour China, fails to halt the programme then the United States will have no choice but to take devastating military action.?They?ve kicked the can down the road for 20 years. There will be a war with North Korea over the missile program if they continue to try to hit America with an ICBM,? he said, describing his discussions with Trump.?He?s told me that. I believe him. If I were China, I would believe him, too, and do something about it. You can stop North Korea, militarily or diplomatically.?I prefer the diplomatic approach. But they will not be allowed to have a missile to hit America with a nuclear weapon on top.? "
41,"Comedian Sunil Pal, in a Facebook video, has accused filmmaker Anees Bazmee and his friend Mayur Barot of not paying Sunil his fees for a stage show. He said he had been invited by them to perform at a family function eight months ago. Sunil added that he is planning to take legal action against them.","After accusing director Anees Bazme and his friend and associate Mayur Barot for non-payment of dues, comedian Sunil Pal is now planning to take legal action against both of them. However, Anees completely denies the charges. ?About eight months back I was asked by Anees Bazmee and his friend Mayur Barot to perform at a family function (in Mumbai). They told me I will be paid a certain amount later. But I never got my payment. And while Anees Bazmi got busy with his film, Mubarakan, Barot kept on telling me that they were getting a cheque drawn out for me. After so much of drama when nothing happened, I even messaged Anees Bazmi saying that I am planning to file a police compliant. I was shocked when he replied that I can do whatever I want to and that it won?t affect him,? says Sunil, adding both of them even said that they would cast him in their films but that too never happened. Meanwhile, the comedian-actor also contacted Cine And TV Artistes Association (CINTAA) and they had asked him to come with a written complaint. But Sunil never went to the cops because he thought that filing a case would take too much time. He therefore decided to make a video with a message for Bazmee and shared it on his Facebook page. In the video he says that he is sorry that Mubarakan didn?t work, and that its God?s way of showing justice to those who wrong others.?I made the video and sent it to Anees Bazmee around noon on Monday but he didn?t reply. So I thought I must upload it on Facebook. Some people have come to my support. Now I am planning to take legal action against both of them. I won?t let them get away like this,? adds Sunil of The Great Indian Laughter Challenge fame.Director Anees Bazmee denied the allegation brought against him by Sunil Pal.When we got in touch with Bazmee he said that the deal happened between Mayur and Sunil and he has nothing to do in it. ?I was just a mediator, who introduced them, beyond that I know nothing. Why will I do something like this for such a small amount? Sunil used to visit my Mumbai office and he was looking for work. Also I never promised to cast him in my film,? says the Welcome Back (2015) director. Voicing a similar opinion, Barot points out that the reason Sunil has dragged Bazmee?s name is because he is a well-known person. ?Sir (Anees Bazmi) has nothing to do with it. Sunil was looking for work and wanted to perform at this function. There was no discussion regarding remuneration. But then after sometime he said he wants his payment and even used foul language when I refused. His false accusation is defamatory for someone like me who is just starting his journey (he is producing Remo Dsouza?s film Nawabzade) in Bollywood. I just wanted to help Sunil, but it backfired,? adds Barot. Follow @htshowbiz for more"

The ban is to remain in effect for one year, unless it is revoked sooner by US secretary of state Rex Tillerson.The travel ban was first announced last month in the wake of the death of American student Otto Warmbier who fell into a coma after being imprisoned by Pyongyang during a tourist visit.Warmbier, 22, a student at the University of Virginia, died in June after being held for more than a year on charges of stealing a propaganda poster from a North Korean hotel - and sent home in a mysterious coma that proved fatal.After his death, President Donald Trump said he was determined to ?prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency.?Warmbier?s death added to already high tensions in the region over North Korea?s weapons ambitions, culminating in two successful test launches by Pyongyang in recent weeks of an intercontinental ballistic missile that experts say could reach US territory."

Noting that the airline has debt of over ?50,000 crore, he said it is ""not small"" and ""now we have to decide what has to be done with Air India"".","New Delhi, Aug 1 (PTI) Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said a ""proper decision"" would be taken on Air Indias future in a competitive market and that it would be in the governments interest to protect jobs at the airline. His remarks come at a time when a group of ministers headed by him is working on the modalities for the divestment of loss-making Air India. In a competitive market, challenges are different and a ""proper decision"" would be taken on what Air India has to do in such a market, Jaitley said in the Lok Sabha. ""Is mein karmchariyon ke services bachee rahen, is mein hamara bhi swarth hai (It will be in the interest of the government to protect the jobs at Air India),"" he said while replying to a discussion on Supplementary Demands for Grants. Noting that the airline has a debt of Rs 50,0000-55,000 crore which is ""not small"", he said, ""now we have to decide what has to be done with the Air India"". He also wondered for how long can tax collected from the public be given to the public sector airline. The previous UPA government had extended bailout package worth little over Rs 30,000 crore to the national carrier for a 10-year period starting from 2012. "
45,"UK roadside repair firm AA on Tuesday lost over £200 million (nearly ?1,690 crore) or nearly a fifth of its value. This came after shares fell as much as 18% during the day after it fired its Executive Chairman Bob Mackenzie with immediate effect for 'gross misconduct'. However, his son said he resigned over an 'extremely distressing mental health issue'. ","The AA has fired its boss, Bob Mackenzie, for ?gross misconduct?, with immediate effect, wiping nearly a fifth off the value of the company and making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 250.?Bob Mackenzie has been removed by the board from his role as executive chairman, from his other roles and as a director and as an employee of the company, for gross misconduct,? the AA said.A spokesperson for the roadside repair company said the sacking was a ?personal conduct related matter?, but gave no further details. It is not believed to involve fraud.However, a statement attributed by the Times to Mackenzie?s son, Peter Mackenzie, said his father had a serious health issue and had resigned. The statement said his father had tendered his resignation and resigned his directorships due to acute ill health. ?He is very unwell and has been admitted to hospital,? it said. ?The family trusts that all parties will act responsibly towards a loyal servant of the company in a manner which reflects the stress he has been suffering.?The company declined to comment beyond its initial statement.The shock announcement sent shares down as much as 18% at one point. The shares closed down 14%, wiping about £200m off the value of the company.Mackenzie, 65, has been executive chairman of the AA since 2014, when he was instrumental in a stock market flotation of the company. His previous roles include chairman and chief executive of National Car Parks and its subsidiary Green Flag, a rival car breakdown business.The AA said Mackenzie?s responsibilities would be split, with Simon Breakwell, a non-executive director since 2014 and a founder of the travel company Expedia, appointed as acting chief executive. John Leach, who was senior independent director, has been appointed as chairman.The company had already announced plans to split the combined roles of executive chairman, with the aim of appointing a chief executive.In a trading update published alongside the announcement of Mackenzie?s departure, the AA said it was confident about the company?s long-term prospects but its financial performance in the first half of 2017 had been hit by a number of factors.?The financial performance in the first six months has been negatively impacted by the effect of erratic work load patterns on an inherently fixed cost base. This was especially true in June and July which saw significant spikes in demand.?We now expect the full-year performance to be broadly in line with that of the last financial year.?The AA said paid members totalled 3.33 million in the first six months of the year, an increase of 6,000 compared with the same period a year earlier. The company would publish first-half results on 26 September. ?At that stage, Simon Breakwell will be in a position to provide an update on our plans,? the company said.Analysts at Liberum noted their surprise at Mackenzie?s departure, adding that they ?do not believe that it is fraud-related?.They revised down their expectations for full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation by 3% to £403m, but said the company had made progress in some areas. ?After the accelerated [stock market listing] in July 2014, management had acquired a strategic asset akin to a desirable residence in Mayfair, where the plumbing and electrics were in need of investment,? the Liberum analysts said. ?We now believe that the face-lift is largely complete.?Some of the key metrics are generally encouraging, although that may be lost today. The transformation may have taken longer but there is tangible evidence of improvement.?The AA said that existing board member Andrew Blowers would replace John Leach as senior independent director, while Martin Clarke continues as finance director."

47,"Actor Naseeruddin Shah, while talking about the controversy around 'Lipstick Under My Burkha', said that one needs to ask a psychiatrist why the Censor Board is afraid of female sexuality on screen. He added, ""It's very frightening to see that the Censor Board can do whatever it wants and practise its biases openly and ban films that it doesn't like.""","Naseeruddin Shah has watched the film Lipstick Under My Burkha, starring his wife Ratna Pathak Shah, twice. And the veteran actor can?t figure out why the film was initially denied certification by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), aka Censor Board. ?I really don?t know what problem they had with the film. I think they have a problem with female sexuality being portrayed on screen. What the film?s success has done is that it has shown [the Censor Board] up, and what they thought about the film. I have seen the film twice, and it?s a wonderfully made film that talks about what?s going on in society. I don?t know why the Censor Board had a problem with that,? he quips. The CBFC letter informing the filmmakers that certification wouldn?t be given had called the film ?lady-oriented?, a perplexing word that drew much ridicule from filmmakers and actors. Afterwards, the Lipstick team got the required clearance from a parallel body. This has been one of the most high-profile tussles between the Censor Board and film teams in recent memory.With Lipstick?s release stalled for almost six months, director Alankrita Shrivastava and her team fought to get a clean chit, and finally received it from the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal, which asked for 16 cuts in the film. Naseeruddin Shah says, ?One has to ask a psychiatrist as to why they are afraid of [female sexuality] on screen. It?s very frightening to see that the Censor Board can do whatever it wants and practise its biases openly and ban films that it doesn?t like. But the success of such films prove that no one is bothered about what the Censor Board or the doubters think about [these] films.?Shah also criticises the Censor Board for being dictatorial. ?For starters,? he says, ?they are supposed to give a film a certificate; they are no authority to ban a film, or stay its release. But then they claim to be someone who can do that. Their narrow-minded approach affects the film industry. But nothing has been done about it.?Follow @htshowbiz for more "
